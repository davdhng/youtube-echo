# YouTube Echo

YouTube Echo is a music player for your tray built in Electron. It solves the problem of being constantly distracted trying to find music on YouTube by

1. Hiding the interface and only giving you a searchbar and the top 5 results
2. Playing the same song on repeat to get you into a flow state

YouTube Echo is a work in progress, so expect bugs. For example, it's currently only built for Windows and can't play videos that disabled embeds (which is a lot of videos)

## Getting Started
Clone it I guess

**TODO** Be more specific


## Contributing
This app has a lot of issues so it would be nice if you would open one once in a while.
